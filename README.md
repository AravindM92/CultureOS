# Overview of Thun.ai - Your Friendly AI Colleague

This app template is built on top of [Teams AI library V2](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library-v2). 
It showcases Thun.ai, a friendly AI colleague that responds to user questions and helps with work tasks, enabling your users to collaborate with the AI agent in Teams using Groq Cloud's fast inference models.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 20, 22.
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
> - An account with [Groq Cloud](https://groq.com/) and an API key.

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your Groq API key `SECRET_GROQ_API_KEY=<your-key>` and optionally set your preferred model `GROQ_MODEL_NAME=llama-3.1-70b-versatile`.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running Thun.ai that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground:

|`m365agents.local.yml`|This overrides `m365agents.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.|
|`m365agents.playground.yml`|This overrides `m365agents.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.|

## Groq Cloud Integration

This template uses Groq Cloud for fast inference with open-source language models. Groq offers:

- **Ultra-fast inference**: Groq's hardware provides significantly faster response times compared to traditional cloud services
- **Open-source models**: Access to models like Llama 3.1, Mixtral, and Gemma
- **Cost-effective**: Competitive pricing for AI model inference
- **High throughput**: Optimized for real-time applications

### Available Models

The template is configured to use `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` by default, but you can choose from:

- `llama-3.1-405b-reasoning` - Largest model for complex reasoning tasks
- `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` - Balanced performance and capability
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant` - Fastest responses for simple tasks
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` - Excellent for multilingual tasks
- `gemma2-9b-it` - Google's efficient model

To change the model, update the `GROQ_MODEL_NAME` environment variable in your `.env.playground.user` file.

## Extend the template
