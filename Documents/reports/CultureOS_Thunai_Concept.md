**Culture OS – Thunai: Your Team Companion**

---

### 2. Concept Overview

**a) Problem Statement**  
Enhancing team engagement and predicting Work From Office (WFO) prediction.

**b) Solution**  
Introducing a cheerful, friendly virtual assistant – *Thunai Bot* – designed to foster team bonding and celebrate everyday moments. One of its key modules is WFO Prediction, which can be seamlessly integrated into the bot’s capabilities.

**c) Approach**  
Rather than relying solely on predictive models, we gather actual data directly from employees through daily or weekly interactions with the bot. Using the **Moments** module, we create a culture of celebration and connection, increasing the likelihood of employees choosing to come to the office.

**d) User Experience**  
Thunai Bot is designed to be:
- Friendly and cheerful
- Slightly sarcastic – like that fun teammate everyone enjoys
- Integrated with Microsoft Teams for easy access and daily interaction  
(Demo available in Teams playground)

### 7. Main Use Case: WFO Prediction

**How we achieve it**  
Thunai Bot interacts with users daily, collecting actual intent data in a friendly manner .

**How it works**  
Instead of predicting, we ask users directly (e.g., at 8 PM the night before) whether they plan to come to the office.
